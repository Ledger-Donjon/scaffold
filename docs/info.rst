Three connectors allow using external power supplies instead of the 5 V USB
source. Power sources can be selected using the jumpers CN203, CN201 and CN206.
All the board can be powered using a single external power supply.
Independently, platform and DUT sockets can also be powered using external power
supplies.

External power supplies current must be limited to a current less than 5 A.
When using multiple power supplies, connect their ground signals together.

See :ref:`Using external power supplies <external_power_supplies>` for more information.
